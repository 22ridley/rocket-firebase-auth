## Run it Locally

In order to get this example running on your local environment, we need to run both the frontend and backend servers.
We use `pnpm` as our package manager for the frontend example, so make sure you have that installed.

Run the frontend:

```sh
cd web && pnpm dev
```

Run the backend:

```sh
cd server && cargo run
```
